EDIT :
One small confusion that might arise for you in question 2 part 1 is the depiction of the path in this file. Hence to make it easier, Please run this code with the images organized in the same path as the .py file. Also, please ignore the writeup on how the path WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MENTIONED as per the README for question 2 part 1. This should run just fine. A video of the run is uploaded on Youtube as well, linked in the README.

Please feel free to contact me, incase you face any issue (especially an image.shape error) This is because the code is working fine, any error caused is because of the directory.

There are three codes attached without any sub-directories. 

The codes in .py files are as follows:

The Youtube links to the videos are as follows:

All the media files have been attached there as well, to read the data from the same folder.

Question 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the video containing the car driving in the dark is there in the directory.
The code will output an improved video and will write it to the directory as well under the name output and in .avi format.

Question 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that a folder called 'data' is present in the directory. This folder contains the images neeeded for solving Problem 2

A sample folder path for all the images that was initially given are:
'C:\\Users\\govin\\OneDrive - University of Maryland\\UMD DOCS\Semester 2\\ENPM673\\Project 2\\data\\'
A sample folder path for all the images that were edited and to generate the final video are:
C:\\Users\\govin\\OneDrive - University of Maryland\\UMD DOCS\Semester 2\\ENPM673\\Project 2\\proj_2_q_2_1\\

Make sure these two are correctly given


Also make sure that there is an empty folder called the proj_2_q_2_1. This is where the modified images are going to be added to, before they form the video.
The video is made already and a copy is uploaded onto Youtube, links to which are provided below.

Question 3:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the video containing the car driving in along the path is there in the directory.
This directory is called data_2.
The format is similar to: r'C:\Users\nsraj\Downloads\challenge_video.mp4'
The code will output an improved video and will write it to the directory as well.
