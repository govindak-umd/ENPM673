Project 1 Submission - ENPM673 - Perception for Autonomous Robotics
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are four codes attached without any sub-directories. 
All the media files have been attached there as well, to read the data from the same folder.
Two notebooks in which the entirety of the code was developed is attached as well.

Group members :

Ashwin Prabhakar
Govind Ajith Kumar
Rajeshwar N S 

Programme used:
Python 3.7
OpenCV 4.xx
The four .py files are as follows :

Tag Detection and ID.py
Lena on AR Tag.py
Cube on AR Tag.py
Multiple Tags.py

The following media files are important to run the .py files without any errors:

Lena.png
Tag0.mp4
Tag1.mp4
Tag2.mp4
multipleTags.mp4

Steps to run the programme:

1. Make sure the following libraries are installed and imported properly:
	numpy
	OpenCV-Python3
	matplotlib
	functools - reduce
	operator
	math

2. Make sure the videos and the Lena image are placed in the same folder as the code. (Note::  > Please paste them seperately in the directory, as the upload size was very high (approx: 212MB))

3. Run the code Tag_Detection_and_ID.py for AR tag detection and the encoding. Give different video names for other labels. Check the output console for the encoded label.

4. Run the code to perform Cube_on_AR_Tag.py superimposing an image on the detected tag.

5. Run the code Cube_on_AR_Tag.py to render a 3D cube on the tag.

Note:

All the videos that are shown on the screen are recorded and will be populated in the folder as well.
A link to the videos are pasted below :
